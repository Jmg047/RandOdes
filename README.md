# QuoteGenerator

This project displays a quote with
the author's name displayed sourced 
from Quotes-Api by Andre Neagoie & Jacinto Wong

← `README.md`

← `index.html`

← `style.css`

← `script.js`

The quotes and their respective authors are fetched 
in the .JS file from Quotes API. There is a 
Loader to let the user know there is activity
in the back-end going on while JS fetches each
quote and author. The user can click the 
Twitter button for the user to be redirected
to twitter with a pre-populated tweet of the 
quote they have. The Twitter button icon 
was sourced from Font Awesome's icons collection.
